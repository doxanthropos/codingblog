A few days ago I read an article on [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5 "an article that I strongly advise to read") about possible security issues that come with the way many modern websites are built. A day later I found it [referenced](https://blog.fefe.de/?ts=a4abe6d3 "With a well deserved 'told you so' as the last words") on a blog that I read regularly read that obviously does not have this problem.
