This is a personal compilation of the answers to this question:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want &quot;healing&quot; to be a genre of games. It&#39;s means they&#39;re touching, gentle, warm and/or make you feel healed when you&#39;re done. Are there any games you&#39;d put in this category? (They can still be intense or even scary at times, but overall healing.)</p>&mdash; Der Zack (@williamzwood) <a href="https://twitter.com/williamzwood/status/1039062614687416320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">10.
