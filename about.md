Hi! My name is Knut and this is my blog, as you would have guessed.
I like writing code and thinking about programming, gaming and learning.

You can find most of the code that I write on [Github][ghdoxanthropos] and if you want to contact me, why not use [Twitter][twdoxanthropos]?

<!-- When I first started to write a blog, it was mostly commentary about German political topics. It was a place for me to voice opinions and I was (and am) convinced, that having opinions and talking about them is a good and natural idea for humans. So my tagline was for some time "Meinen ist menschlich", roughly translated "Having opinions is human", a playful variation on "Irren ist menschlich", "To err is human" based on a longer quote from Seneca ""Errare humanum est, sed in errare perseverare diabolicum."
So in thinking that having opinions is a basic element of the human condition, I coined this pseudo-ancient-greek word "doxanthropos" from the word "doxa" meaning perspective or opinion and "anthropos" meaning human. -->
